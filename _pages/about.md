Hello, I’m **Rumman Ahmed Prodhan**, a researcher and lecturer passionate about **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. My interdisciplinary work spans **computer vision**, **signal processing**, and **deep learning**, focusing on applications that merge research innovation with real-world impact.

### Academic and Professional Highlights
I am currently a **Lecturer** in the **Department of Computer Science & Engineering** at **Northern University Bangladesh**, where I teach courses such as Database Management Systems, Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, and Software Development. I actively supervise undergraduate theses and projects centered on machine learning and deep learning.  

Previously, I worked at the **Neuro-Analytics Lab**, **New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), USA**, as a **Volunteer Research Assistant**, contributing to emotion recognition research and publishing in MDPI Sensors. I also have R&D experience from **Bondstein Technologies Ltd.**, where I developed a **real-time conveyor belt fault detection system** for **British American Tobacco (BAT)**.

### Education
