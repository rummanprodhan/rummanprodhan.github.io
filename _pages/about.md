Hello, I’m **Rumman Ahmed Prodhan**, a dedicated researcher and educator in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. My work spans interdisciplinary applications, including **image processing**, **signal processing**, and **deep learning**, with contributions that bridge academia and industry.

### Academic and Professional Highlights
I am a **Lecturer** at the **Department of Computer Science & Engineering**, **Northern University Bangladesh**, where I mentor students and lead projects in AI, machine learning, and software development. I am also preparing to pursue a **Ph.D. in Computer Science**, focusing on innovative AI-driven solutions.

- **Education**: Graduated with distinction from the **University of Asia Pacific** with a **BSc in Computer Science & Engineering**, earning multiple Vice Chancellor’s and Dean’s Awards.
- **Publications**: I have published in reputed venues, including **MDPI Sensors**, **IEEE**, **Springer**, and **Taylor & Francis**, such as:
  - *“M1M2: Deep Learning-Based Real-Time Emotion Recognition from Neural Activity”* (Sensors).
  - *“Enhanced Pediatric Dental Segmentation Using a Custom SegUNet with VGG19 Backbone on Panoramic Radiographs”* (ICCIT 2024).
  - Conference presentations at **ABC** (London) and **ICSADL** (Nepal).
- **Industry Experience**: Developed a **real-time fault detection system** using computer vision at Bondstein Technologies for British American Tobacco.

### Notable Contributions
- Co-authored the journal paper *“M1M2: Deep Learning-Based Real-Time Emotion Recognition from Neural Activity”* (MDPI Sensors, IF: 3.8) as an equally contributing first author during my time at NJIT.
- Presented research as the first author at **ABC** (London) and **MIET** (Bangladesh), focusing on multitask learning and EEG-based emotion recognition.
- Supervised *“Enhanced Pediatric Dental Segmentation Using a Custom SegUNet with VGG19 Backbone on Panoramic Radiographs,”* recently accepted at ICCIT 2024.

### Research Interests
