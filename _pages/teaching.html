<h2>Courses Conducted</h2>

<p>I have been serving as a <strong>Lecturer</strong> in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at <strong>Northern University Bangladesh</strong> since <strong>September 2022</strong>. I conduct both theory and lab courses, focusing on the practical integration of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering. The courses I have conducted include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Expert System</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Database Management Systems (Theory & Lab)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Operating Systems</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Computer Architecture</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Software Development</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>My teaching emphasizes hands-on implementation, real-world datasets, and project-based learning to help students bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and applied problem-solving.</p>

<h2>Research Supervision</h2>

<p>Alongside teaching, I actively supervise undergraduate thesis and research projects that apply <strong>deep learning</strong>, <strong>computer vision</strong>, and <strong>AI for healthcare</strong>. Current and recent supervised projects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Enhanced Pediatric Dental Segmentation Using a Custom SegUNet with VGG19 Backbone</strong> — Accepted at ICCIT 2024</li>
  <li><strong>Multimodal Deep Learning for Handwritten Prescription Recognition with Explainable AI</strong> — Submitted to ICCIT 2025</li>
  <li><strong>Pediatric Teeth Segmentation from Dental Radiographs Using Transfer Learning</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Autism Care Network</strong> – An online-based academic platform for autistic children</li>
  <li><strong>NUB Online Examination System</strong> – A web-based assessment management platform</li>
</ul>

<h2>Independent Research and Development</h2>

<p>Beyond institutional supervision, I conduct independent research and system development projects focused on real-time AI applications, federated learning, and human behavior understanding. Selected works include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Subject-Independent Emotion Recognition from EEG Signals</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Cross-Domain Federated Learning for Skin Disease Classification</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Emotion and Attendance System</strong> – A Raspberry Pi-based deep learning system for classroom analytics</li>
  <li><strong>Conveyor Belt Fault Detection System</strong> – An industrial AI solution for British American Tobacco (BAT)</li>
</ul>

<p>Through both my teaching and research mentorship, I strive to inspire students to explore innovative AI-driven solutions while continuously advancing my own research in human-centered and healthcare-focused artificial intelligence.</p>
