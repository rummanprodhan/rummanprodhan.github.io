## Abstract 
Pediatric dental segmentation is critical in dental diagnostics, presenting unique challenges due to variations in dental structures and the lower number of pediatric X-ray images. This study proposes a custom SegUNet model with a VGG19 backbone, designed explicitly for pediatric dental segmentation and applied to the Children's Dental Panoramic Radiographs dataset. The SegUNet architecture with a VGG19 backbone has been employed on this dataset for the first time, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The model reached an accuracy of 97.53%, a dice coefficient of 92.49%, and an intersection over union (IOU) of 91.46%, setting a new benchmark for this dataset. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the VGG19 backbone in enhancing feature extraction and improving segmentation precision. Comprehensive evaluations across metrics, including precision, recall, and specificity, indicate the robustness of this approach. The model's ability to generalize across diverse dental structures makes it a valuable tool for clinical applications in pediatric dental care. It offers a reliable and efficient solution for automated dental diagnostics.
